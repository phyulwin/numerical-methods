Numerical Methods

## About the Course  
This course focused on the mathematical foundations and computational methods for solving numerical problems commonly encountered in computer science. Topics included:

- Linear algebra concepts (matrix operations, transformations)
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Least squares approximations
- Floating-point arithmetic and error analysis
- Solving non-linear equations
- Systems of linear equations
- Interpolation techniques
- Numerical integration

The course combined mathematical theory with practical C++ programming, giving us a strong foundation in both accuracy and efficiency when working with real-world numerical data.

## What I Did  
As a student in this class, I completed multiple hands-on programming projects where I implemented algorithms for:

- Solving systems using Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition
- Root-finding using Newton-Raphson and bisection methods
- Interpolation using Lagrange and Newton techniques
- Eigenvalue calculation and matrix operations
- Least squares regression and numerical integration

All projects were coded in C++ and focused on applying theoretical methods to actual computations with a strong emphasis on precision, performance, and debugging floating-point behaviors.

## What I Learned  
- How to translate math-heavy algorithms into working code
- Debugging numerical precision issues in C++
- Applying linear algebra to solve engineering problems
- Writing cleaner and more modular code for complex math problems
